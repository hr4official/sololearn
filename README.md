#solution3
FizzBuzz is a well known programming assignment, asked during interviews.

The given code solves the FizzBuzz problem and uses the words "Solo" and "Learn" instead of "Fizz" and "Buzz". 
It takes an input n and outputs the numbers from 1 to n.
For each multiple of 3, print "Solo" instead of the number. 
For each multiple of 5, prints "Learn" instead of the number. 
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, output "SoloLearn". 

You need to change the code to skip the even numbers, so that the logic only applies to odd numbers in the range.
